    <p>Learn any language with a spreadsheet and a dictaphone</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Get yourself a dictaphone (I use a Philips voice tracer LFH0602) and record whenever you find yourself with a missing word, phrase or sentence in the language you want to learn</li>
      <li>Whenever you find time, play back the recordings and add them to your spreadsheet</li>
      <li>If you need more empty rows, put an x into cell A1.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Benefits and advantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Translates automatically using Deepl and Google Translate (to compare results between the two)</li>
      <li>Can be accessed from anywhere with a smartphone/tablet (Google Sheets app) or in a web browser (using a laptop or computer)</li>
      <li>Never forget your missing words by using your dicatphone in the moment when you were looking for the right vocabulary.</li>
      <li>Can be easily searched with the built-in search function that Google Sheets provides</li>
    </ul>
    <p>How to set up the spreadsheet</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Make a copy of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1myg1YmufkvfzSyj5fyr4C7cCV4A8st3zaJHDATiG3lk/edit#gid=0">this sheet</a></li>
      <li>Get yourself a Deepl account to obtain your API key</li>
      <li>Edit the Google Script and add your own API key</li>
    </ol>
